ZeroMQ sockets provide an\r\nabstraction of asynchronous message queues, multiple messaging patterns,\r\nmessage filtering (subscriptions), seamless access to multiple transport\r\nprotocols and more.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Building and installation\r\n\r\nSee the INSTALL file included with the distribution.\r\n\r\n## Resources\r\n\r\nExtensive documentation is provided with the distribution.
